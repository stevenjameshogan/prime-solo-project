# NutriSaver

NutriSaver is a full-stack, multi-featured mobile application which aims to reduce individual food waste, save users time and money. This app provides users with a virtual “snapshot” of their current food supply, including detailed information regarding food item quantities, where they are physically stored (fridge, freezer, pantry) and their estimated expiration dates. It also allows them to quickly find recipes built around ingredients on-hand via the Yummly API. I built this application in only 2 Weeks as part of my Prime Academy Solo Project, using ReactJS, Redux, Node, Express, PostgreSQL, and more.

Since the nature of this app is highly personal in nature, all users are first required to sign in using their unique username and password.
